# Demo Explorer

Demo project using MobX State Tree, React and Typescript. The main state is completely decoupled from UI (_look ma' no `useState`_). Focus management is also decoupled from the main components and put in a separate [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) layer, so the foundation for a more accessible web app is laid!
